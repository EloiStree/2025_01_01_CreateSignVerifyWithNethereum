# 2025_01_01_CreateSignVerifyWithNethereum

Using a bazooka to kill a fly, this tool refers to Neuthereum for creating, signing, and verifying messages.
I'm not wrapping Nethereum; I'm offering a tool that uses Nethereum to create sign and verify messages in a way that's compatible with MetaMask. If you have suggestions for making it lightweight and user-friendly across all platforms, feel free to reach out.
